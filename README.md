# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
This model is an XGBoost model for Big Mart Sales Prediction.  <br> <br>

Here, we have used the training dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data <br>
Then, manipulated the data, i.e., filling the missing values in the dataset. <br>
Then, we analysed the data, i.e., distribution of data or count of data. <br>
Then, performed label encoding for categorical features. <br>
Then, we have applied XGBoost regressor to the model. <br>

Finally, calculated the R squared value and it comes across 0.8  <br>
